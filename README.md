# Blockchain Explorer & Validator

A web-based, interactive application that demonstrates the core concepts of a simple **Proof-of-Work blockchain**.  
Users can visualize a live blockchain, mine new blocks, and validate the integrity of an entire chain from an uploaded file.


##  Features
- Visualize a live blockchain 
- Mine new blocks with Proof-of-Work (SHA-256)  
- Validate the integrity of an uploaded blockchain file  


## Technical Details

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js  
- **Framework:** Express.js  

### Frontend
- **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3  

### Hashing Algorithm
